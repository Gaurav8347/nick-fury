**Abstract**-Due to digitalization there is rise in the number of online transactions. With this the probability of fraud transaction also increases. Using machine learning approach this can be detected efficiently. Machine learning adapts to changing behaviors in a population through automated model building. With every iteration, the algorithms get smarter and deliver more accurate results. It comprises the method of identifying relevant records in a database, preferably of determining potentially fraudulent records in said database, comprising: providing a graphical user interface to a user to display multiple inputs, to receive inputs from the user and to display results; defining a first detection strategy targeted to detect existing records from the database, the first detection strategy comprising multiple first inputs and at least one parameter, wherein the first inputs can be individually displayed on said graphical user interface for each of the at least one detection method, wherein the first inputs can preferably be individually set for each of the at least one detection method and algorithms determine the fraudulent transactions.
**Functioning of Project**
   1.It is Fraud Transaction Detection using Machine Learning. In this there are 4 modules covered.
    ->DashBoard is created.
    In the dashboard there are different are different options for user to do. From this page user can click in **Continue Netbanking**
    User gets redirected to new page on which there are 2 options given:
      1.Register.
      2.Login.
      In Register there are  fields.
      **Customer id
      **Name
      **E-mailId
      **Password
      **Re-enter Password
      **Gender
      **DateOfBirth(dob)
      **PlaceOfBirth(pob)
      
     and using Submit Button User gets redirected to login page.
     
      In Login Page there are fields like.
      
      **CustomerId
      **Password
      
      Then details are matched and if it is there in database then users dashboard will be visible.
      
      From there user can carry his transaction.
       Our MAchine Learning model will predict whether this transaction is fruadulent or not.
       If transaction might be fraudulent then security question will be asked else Success.
